PSQGIS.com was reorganized in March 2018. The [meeting minutes](/minutes.html) were moved from our [blog](\blog) to their own page. This clears up the confusion of the minutes being listed in the blog by publication date instead of meeting date.

The [PSQGIS resources page](\resources.html) was redesigned to make updates quicker and easier.

Finally there is now a [browse by subject page](\tags.html) to help you find things. All of the resources and a good portion of the minutes were given subject tags. The remaining minutes will be tagged soon.

There is a lot of great information on our site provided by our members. Please check it out.

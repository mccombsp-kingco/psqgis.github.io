We have found a new location thanks to the kind folks at InterIM CDA. Check out their [website](http://interimicda.org/whatwedo/) and learn about the great work that they do to advance social justice.

We will be meeting at 310 Mayard Ave South, Seattle WA 98104.

Peter will be bringing a projector, so bring your laptop if you have something to share. That's what we are all about.

### Update from Stu Smith
Stu here... I've been teaching myself about the QGIS Graphical Modeler (similar to ESRI's Modelbuilder), and will be willing to give the group an intro at the November meeting. The Graphical Modeler is a visual way to create QGIS tools, particularly those that perform repetetive tasks. See you there!

We have found a new location thanks to the kind folks at InterIM CDA. Check out their [website](http://interimicda.org/whatwedo/) and learn about the great work that they do to advance social justice.

We will be meeting at 310 Mayard Ave South, Seattle WA 98104.

Other potential topics for the Meeting:

+ A review of Matt Stevenson's workshop on [Cartography with QGIS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nMosVjadS2wA2QEdUcQx_mFzePWPpBJSmm31t3T_258/edit#slide=id.p)  which he lead at the October meeting of Maptime Seattle.
+ Peter has an idea for community project of a QGIS cookbook that we can collaborate on in real time. Bring your laptop!
+ Plan topics for future monthly meetings.

Peter will be bringing a projector, so bring your laptop if you have something to share. That's what we are all about.

We have found a new location thanks to the kind folks at InterIM CDA. Check out their [website](http://interimicda.org/whatwedo/) and learn about the great work that they do to advance social justice.

We will be meeting at 310 Mayard Ave South, Seattle WA 98104.

Potential topics for the Meeting:

+ A review of Matt Stevenson's workshop on [Cartography with QGIS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nMosVjadS2wA2QEdUcQx_mFzePWPpBJSmm31t3T_258/edit#slide=id.p)  which he lead at the October meeting of Maptime Seattle.
+ Peter has an idea for community project of a QGIS cookbook that we can collaborate on in real time. Bring your laptop!
+ Plan topics for future monthly meetings.

Peter will be bringing a projector, so bring your laptop if you have something to share. That's what we are all about.

The September meeting was held at the Northgate Library.

Peter Keum gave a summary of his trip to [FOSS4G Boston 2017](http://2017.foss4g.org/), presenting his [notes at PKGeo.com](http://pkgeo.com/2017-09-10-summaryFOSS4G/), focusing on the QGIS content.
Of particular interest was the news that [QGIS 3.0 is coming soon](http://www.digital-geography.com/short-announcement-qgis-3-0-is-on-its-way/).

There was discussion of Evan Derickson's experience teaching QGIS workshops at the [Washington URISA Conference](http://www.waurisa.org/conferences/2017_Conference_Index.php) and the [CUGOS Spring Fling](http://cugos.org/2017-spring-fling/).
We also discussed Robert Catherman's experience teaching medical doctors in Vietnam and looked at _Monitoring Health Outcomes Using QGIS_ manual he produced, which is available on our [Resources web page](resources.html).
Peter Keum suggested that plan on offering a class and next years Washington URISA Conference and donate any proceeds to a worthy cause.

Peter also noted that as a user group we could get a free booth at the Washington URISA Conference.
There was interest expressed in pursuing this for 2018.

We were packed into a small room and I did not have room to take notes. If anyone has corrections or additions they would like to make to these notes please let Paul McCombs know, or submit a pull request on [github](https://github.com/psqgis/psqgis.github.io)

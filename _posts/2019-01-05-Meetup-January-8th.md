### Agenda: ###

1. Bob Catherman will briefly share his experience with use of QGIS at Hue University of Sciences in Vietnam.
2. I heard a rumor that Stu was planning on coming, but he hasn't RSVPed, so I'm considering that a maybe.
3. Clifford may be discussing a freehand georeferencing plugin.

There is room for a few more topics. Let us know if you've got anything.

* There was a turn-out of eight people attending the meetup.
* We opened with a discussion of business. Stu Smith has decided to discontinue paying for Meetup.com and we will switch to a Google Groups [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psqgis). Peter Keum and Paul McCombs were added as co-organizers on the Meetup.com account for the remaining time, as well as managers of the Google Group.
* Joel Masselink demonstrated the [Quick Map Services](http://nextgis.com/blog/quickmapservices/) plug-in for QGIS
	* Allows you to add web map services to qgis.
		* Google maps
		* Google satellite view
		* Open street map
		* Mapbox map services
	* We discussed what may or may not be legal to do with these map services.
		* Joel determined that commercial sources should not be used to enter data into open street map.
	* Once the plug-in is loaded go into Web Menu, select Quick Map Services go to Settings. Change to "More Services" tab and click on "Get Contribution Pack" and then click save.
	* Visibility tab in settings allows you to turn it off
* A discussion of address matching resources yielded two recommendations from the group:
	* Openaddress.io
	* Geocod.io
* Tom Macky is very interested in how to make a time series.
	* Check out the [Time Manager](https://anitagraser.com/projects/time-manager/) plug-in from Anita Grazer.
* Robert Catherman is looking for railroad data.
	* We discussed that Google doesn't allow people to copy and make use of the data they publish, outside of their official services.
	* Stu suggested looking to State government web sites for rail data.
	* Joel suggested the QuickOSM plug as a quick way to access rail data from open street map.
* Stu demonstrated the aggregation of points

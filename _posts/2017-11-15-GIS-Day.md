[GIS Day](http://www.gisday.com/) is the perfect day to make a map.

Check out this article I found: [QGIS vs ArcGIS](http://gisgeography.com/qgis-arcgis-differences/)

We had a great meeting last night with two first time attendees. I will post the minutes soon. The new venue worked out well.
We expect to bring a projector in the future, as the display they have was a little too small for our purposes.

### Agenda: ###

1. Robert Catherman will add some further detail to his previous presentation on the topic of "Using SCP plugin for accuracy assessment of classified Landsat images". He "found the workflow challenging but interesting once [he] figured it out."

Any topics folks like to share/demonstrate, please bring them to share with the group.

Paul McCombs

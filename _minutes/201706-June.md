Peter explored the interesting question: **Can you put use vector tiles with QGIS?**

* In the May 2017 meetup we looked at the promising [Vector Tiles Reader](http://giswiki.hsr.ch/Vector_Tiles_Reader_QGIS_Plugin) plugin.
    * It is now available in the QGIS plugins, requiring version 2.18.
* Using Vector Tiles Reader Peter created a new connection to his tile service but was not able to get it to load.
* Also he could not get the default OpenMapTiles.com service to load.
* Clifford was able to load  MBTiles format data stored locally. It was provided as part of the plugin installation.
    * He had to move it out of the hidden directory it was installed in to get it to work.
* Clifford was running QGIS version 2.18.7 and Peter was running version 2.18.2, both on MacOS.
* Peter upgraded to QGIS 2.18.7 but has python 2.7.2 and it still didn't work.
* Paul upgraded to QGIS 2.18.7 and has python 2.7.10 and it does work with the local file.
    * Paul is also running MacOS
    * Paul still can't load the vector tiles from Peter's server.
        * There was a speculation that it had to do with lack of styling, but we were not able to test that out.
